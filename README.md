## About

![PathPlanner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9343077/211618068-8b4b0edb-d5b2-4247-94ee-119742d4507a.png)
PathPlanner is a motion profile generator for FRC robots created by team 3015. The main features of PathPlanner include:
* Each path is made with BÃ©zier curves, allowing fine tuning of the exact path shape.
* Holonomic mode supports decoupling the robot's rotation from its direction of travel.
* Real-time path preview
* Allows placing "event markers" along the path which can be used to trigger other code while path following.
* Split a path into a "path group" to follow each part of a path seperately.
* Auto path saving and file management
* Robot-side vendor library for path generation and custom path following commands/controllers
* Full autonomous command generation with PathPlannerLib AutoBuilder

## Usage and Documentation
#### [Check the Wiki](https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner/wiki)

Make sure you [install PathPlannerLib](https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner/wiki/PathPlannerLib:-Installing) to generate your paths. Paths can be pre-generated as CSV or WPILib JSON files, but the vendor library is much easier to use and supports all of the features of the GUI.

## How to build manually:
* [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (this project currently uses v3.13.4)
