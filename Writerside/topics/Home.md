PathPlanner is a motion profile generator for FRC robots created by team 3015. The main features of PathPlanner include:

* Each path is made with BÃ©zier curves, allowing fine tuning of the exact path shape.
* Holonomic mode supports decoupling the robot's rotation from its direction of travel.
* Real-time path preview
* Allows placing "event markers" along the path which can be used to trigger other code while path following.
* Build modular autonomous routines using other paths.
* Automatic saving and file management
* Robot-side vendor library for path generation and custom path following commands/controllers
* Full autonomous command generation with PathPlannerLib auto builder
* Real time path following telemetry
* Hot reload (paths and autos can be updated and regenerated on the robot without redeploying code)
* Automatic pathfinding in PathPlannerLib with AD*
