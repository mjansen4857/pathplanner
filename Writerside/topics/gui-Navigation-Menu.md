# Navigation Menu

The navigation menu is used to switch between the different pages in PathPlanner, and to open the settings menu and
switch projects. The navigation menu can be opened via the hamburger menu in the top left of the app.

There are currently three pages that can be switched between:

* [Project Browser](gui-Project-Browser.md)
* [Telemetry](gui-Telemetry.md)
* [Navigation Grid](gui-Navigation-Grid-Editor.md)

You can change robot code projects by clicking the "Switch Project" button at the top of the navigation menu.

The [Settings](gui-Settings.md) menu can be opened via the "Settings" button at the bottom of the navigation menu.
