# Pathfinding

PathPlannerLib now includes a set of commands that will automatically plan a path between two points while avoiding
obstacles on the field. They can also be used to generate a path to another path, allowing you to chain together a
generated and pre-planned path for finer control.

A few important considerations to note before attempting to use these commands:

* There must be a `navgrid.json` file present in your `deploy/pathplanner` directory in order for the system to know
  where obstacles are. This file will be created automatically when opening the project in pathplanner. You can edit the
  navgrid in the GUI, but you probably shouldn't have to.
* You have no control of the robot's heading at the start and end points. In other words, you can't attempt to pathfind
  to a position to the left of the robot, but have it arrive at that point while moving to the right. The shortest path
  from A to B will be used.
* Because of the above, this is more difficult to get great results with a differential drivetrain. It will still be
  possible, you just need to take more care with it. For example, doing a turn in place command if your robot is not
  facing the direction it will travel when pathfinding.
* Even with a holonomic drive train, it's not that great at lining up with things (for example, a human player station)
  because of the heading restriction. This is why the ability to chain paths together exists. It is recommended to
  create a pre-planned path for doing the final line up with something, then pathfind to that path if precision is
  required.
* The AD* algorithm used for pathfinding does not just produce one path, it produces a few as it further refines the
  path in the background. In some rare cases, the robot could start moving in one direction, then switch to the other
  direction when AD* figures out that direction is more optimal.

Compared to the normal path following commands, pathfinding commands have a couple of additional optional parameters:

Goal end velocity
: The velocity the robot should be moving at when reaching the goal position. If pathfinding to a predefined path, this
will be automatically set based on the max velocity of that path

Rotation delay distance
: This parameter controls the distance that the robot should move before attempting to rotate to the goal rotation while
pathfinding. This is useful in cases where you are pathfinding out of a cramped area, avoiding possible collisions from
rotation

> similar and will have similar config to their normal path following command versions.

<u>**Using AutoBuilder**</u>

The easiest way to create a pathfinding command is by using `AutoBuilder`. See [Build an Auto](pplib-Build-an-Auto.md)
to configure AutoBuilder.

PathPlannerLib supports the ability to use a custom pathfinder implementation for pathfinding commands. In order to do
so, your pathfinder must implement the methods in the `Pathfinder` interface.

## Java Warmup

> **Warning**
>
> Due to the nature of how Java works, the first run of a pathfinding command could have a significantly higher delay
> compared with subsequent runs.
>
> To help alleviate this issue, you can run a warmup command in the background when code starts.
>
> This command will not control your robot, it will simply run through a full pathfinding command to warm up the library.

```Java
public void robotInit() {
  // ... all other robot initialization

  // DO THIS AFTER CONFIGURATION OF YOUR DESIRED PATHFINDER
  PathfindingCommand.warmupCommand().schedule();
